utilities and libraries related to lojban
   written in perl5 and python2

lihertadji.pl -- A preprocessor
  likely going to be obsoleted by tadji soon
tadji.pl -- process and transforms a file containing lojban

Lojban/Saprvalsep.pm -- A "simple" word separtator
Lojban/Valsi.pm -- mostly a bunch of regexps to handle words
Lojban/Gerna.pm -- context free grammar with Earley parser

flashcard.py -- attempts to be flash card program
  has some lojban specific quirks
  uses a home-brew spaced repetition heuristic
    similar to Pimsleur and Leitner but tweaked
    acceptable approximate solution but full of magic numbers that need tuning
  early alpha that lacks polish and is a bit crufty in places
  uses gtk+2

Likely a few more will be arriving after I clean them up with perlcritic
