A Bunch of utilities related to lojban written in perl5

lihertadji.pl -- A preprocessor that is likely going to be obsoleted by tadji soon
tadji.pl -- process and transforms a file containing lojban

Lojban/Saprvalsep.pm -- A "simple" word separtator
Lojban/Valsi.pm -- mostly a bunch of regexps to handle words

Likely more will be arriving after I clean them up with perlcritic
I also have a flashcard program written in python that might show up
