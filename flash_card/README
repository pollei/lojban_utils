 there are other alternatives as well
 I've heard great things about anki and supermemeo

 It needs to have cmavo.txt and gismu.txt in a location that it can find them
 I did add stuff so that it will attempt to download the lojban vocab it needs
 http://www.lojban.org/publications/wordlists/cmavo.txt
 http://www.lojban.org/publications/wordlists/gismu.txt
 http://www.lojban.org/publications/wordlists/lujvo.txt
 It also wants valsi_f.txt, which can be created by downloaded big_list
 and trimming it
 http://digitalkingdom.org/~rlpowell/hobbies/lojban/flashcards/big_list
 cut -f1 big_list > valsi_f.txt

 WARNING this is currently alpha level software and I plan on doing
 non-backwards compatible changes to the "progress data" persistent storage
 so don't be surprised on problems and possible data loss if you upgrade

 Want to Remember Everything You'll Ever Learn? Surrender to This Algorithm

 this program uses a home-brew spaced repetition
 for times less than a day or so, it roughly increases the time between
 flashing using a exponential growth formula that takes into consideration
 how much work needs to be done soon
 if the increase between flashing would itself increase by more than a day
 we cap it

 I might want to add support for the "plunge" method

 for rafsi and lujvo I desire better lists of lujvo and stage 3 fu'ivla
